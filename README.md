# 🧺 Washing Machine Simulator with PIC16F877A

This project simulates the core operations of a washing machine using the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**. The embedded C code is developed with **MPLAB X IDE** and compiled using the **XC8 compiler**. The entire logic is thoroughly tested and simulated using **PICSimLab** on the **PICGenios board**, providing a visual representation of the washing machine's stages.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to build and simulate the washing machine project:

### 🧱 Step 1: Open and Build in MPLAB X IDE

1.  **Open Project:** Launch MPLAB X IDE. You can either create a new project and import the `source_files` and `header_files`, or open an existing project if you have one.
2.  **Compiler Selection:** Ensure that the **XC8 compiler** is correctly installed and selected for your project.
3.  **Clean and Build:** Use the **Clean and Build Project** option (the hammer icon in the toolbar) to compile your code. This process will automatically generate the necessary `.hex` file, which is required for simulation. You'll typically find this `.hex` file in the `dist/default/production/` subdirectory of your MPLAB project.

### 🧪 Step 2: Simulate in PICSimLab

1.  **Launch PICSimLab:** Start the PICSimLab application.
2.  **Select Board:** Choose the **PICGenios board** from the available options.
3.  **Select Microcontroller:** Select the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**.
4.  **Load Hex File:** Load the `.hex` file generated in Step 1 (e.g., `washing-machine-simulator.X.production.hex` from your MPLAB project's `dist` directory).
5.  **Start Simulation:** Begin the simulation and observe the washing machine's behavior through the simulated LEDs or other components on the PICGenios board.
